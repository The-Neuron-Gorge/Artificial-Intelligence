This method is particularly effective for tasks such as cycle detection, pathfinding, and topological sorting."

    "Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is a search algorithm that expands the node with the lowest cumulative path cost rather than the one closest in terms of the number of steps. Unlike Breadth-First Search (BFS), which assumes equal cost for every action and explores nodes level by level, UCS uses a priority queue to always choose the least expensive path from the start. This makes it ideal for problems where actions have different costs. In contrast to Depth-First Search (DFS), which dives deep into branches without guaranteeing an optimal or even complete solution, UCS is both complete and optimal (assuming all costs are non-negative), ensuring that the found solution has the lowest overall cost."

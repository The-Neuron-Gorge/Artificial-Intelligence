When it reaches a node with no unvisited neighbors, it backtracks to the most recent node that has unexplored adjacent nodes, continuing this process until every node in the connected component has been visited. This method is particularly effective for tasks such as cycle detection, pathfinding, and topological sorting."

    "Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is a search algorithm that expands the node with the lowest cumulative path cost rather than the one closest in terms of the number of steps. Unlike Breadth-First Search (BFS), which assumes equal cost for every action and explores nodes level by level, UCS uses a priority queue to always choose the least expensive path from the start. This makes it ideal for problems where actions have different costs. In contrast to Depth-First Search (DFS), which dives deep into branches without guaranteeing an optimal or even complete solution, UCS is both complete and optimal (assuming all costs are non-negative), ensuring that the found solution has the lowest overall cost."

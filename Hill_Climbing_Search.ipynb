    "### Hill Climbing Search and Its Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hill Climbing Search** is an optimization algorithm that starts from an arbitrary initial solution and iteratively moves towards a better solution by making local changes. At each step, it chooses the neighboring solution with the highest value based on an evaluation function, with the goal of reaching the optimal solution. Hill climbing is commonly used for problems that require finding a local optimum, and it is a type of local search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Variations:\n",
    "1. **Simple Hill Climbing (SHC)**: Evaluates one neighbor at a time and moves if it improves the solution.\n",
    "3. **Stochastic Hill Climbing (SHC)**: Randomly selects neighbors to explore, helping avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n",
    "4. **First-Choice Hill Climbing (FCHC)**: Randomly selects neighbors and picks the first one that improves the current solution.\n",
    "5. **Random Restart Hill Climbing (RRHC)**: Starts from multiple random solutions to avoid local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "- **Local Optima**: It may get stuck in a suboptimal solution.\n",
    "- **Plateaus**: May fail to progress if neighbors have similar evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hill climbing is simple and effective for large solution spaces but may not always find the best solution."
